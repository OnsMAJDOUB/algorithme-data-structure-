I have explored and tested various data structures and sorting algorithms to enhance my understanding of their practical applications. While I feel confident with common data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, I recognize that I am not yet fully comfortable with more advanced structures like B-trees, AVL trees, and hash tables. The primary reason for this gap is that I haven't had as much hands-on experience or practice with these complex structures in real-world scenarios. Similarly, although I have a solid grasp of fundamental sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, and quicksort, I find myself less proficient with more advanced algorithms like merge sort, heap sort, and radix sort. This is mainly due to the intricate nature of their implementation and optimization, which I haven't had the opportunity to thoroughly explore. I plan to dedicate more time to mastering these advanced topics to strengthen my overall understanding.
